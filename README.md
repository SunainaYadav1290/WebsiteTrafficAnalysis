Project :Website Performance and Clickthrough Rate Analysis 
Goal of the Project:
The goal of this project is to understand this traffic better, in particular the volume 
and distribution of events, and to develop ideas how to increase the links' clickrates. 
With that in mind,analyze the data using the Python libraries Pandas and SciPy
where indicated, providing answers to the presented questions:

How many total pageview events did the links in the provided dataset receive in the full period, how many per day?
Which countries did the pageviews come from?
What was the overall click through rate (clicks/pageviews)?
How does the clickrate distribute across different links?
Is there any correlation between clicks and previews on a link? Is it significant? How large is the effect? Make sure to at least test for potential linear as well as categorical (think binary) relationships between both variables.

●	Conducted website performance analysis using Python, examining pageviews from different countries and identifying the country with the highest traffic
●	Overall Clickthrough Rate: Calculated the overall clickthrough rate by determining the ratio of total clicks to total pageviews..
●	Click Rate Distribution: Analyzed and visualized clickthrough rates across all links to understand distribution patterns.
●	Correlation Testing: Performed correlation analysis, revealing a strong positive correlation (r = 0.98) between clicks and previews, suggesting that these variables are closely related.
